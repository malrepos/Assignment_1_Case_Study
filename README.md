Assignment 1 - Case Study (Aave)

# Aave

Aave is a private company founded in 2017 by Stani Kulechov under the name ETHLend. It began as a decentralized lending platform, rebranding itself as Aave in 2018, and has since expanded into other areas of decentralized finance.

The company has gone through 8 funding rounds beginning with an initial ICO raising of $US 16.5  on November 25th 2017 (https://coincentral.com/what-is-aave/). In total, Aave have raised $49M with the most recent funding round on February 4th, 2022 (https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ethlend/company_financials). There are 6 lead investors in Aave: DTC Capital, Framework Ventures, Blockchain.com Ventures, Standard Crypto, Blockchain Capital and IBM (ibid.)

The company currently has 87 employees (https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/224491-60#overview), although this number has likely changed in recent months. The CEO remains Stani Kulechov.The CFO is Peter Kerr and the CTO is Ernesto Boado

In an interview (https://blog.bitstamp.net/post/interview-with-aaves-founder-stani-kulechov/) Stani relates that the development of what is now Aave began as an interest in Ethereum that, coupled with his interest in finance, opened up for him possibilities of "reshaping the financial system" (.ibid).

The basic framework of Aave is as a decentralised peer to peer lending and borrowing platform. What this means is that lenders and borrowers can interact with each other - borrow and lend - without the need for a trusted third party. What takes the place of this trusted intermediary is a smart contract. Aave is built on the Ethereum mainnet, and has since expanded to layer 2 chains. Aave allows for collateralized lending, more specifically overcollateralized lending. Put simply, the borrower puts up collateral as a guarantee. This collateral is locked and in return the borrower is able to receive a token. This allows the borrower to receive liquidity without selling their original tokens. This opens up short term liquidity that can be used for trading.

It can be hard to accurately calculate the market for Aave's product as it does not fall neatly into simple borrowing and lending, however, the global fintech lending market is projected to reach US$ 3100520 million by 2027 (https://reports.valuates.com/market-reports/QYRE-Auto-10R9175/global-fintech-lending). This is a growing market that is responding to the opaque and often needlessly complicated and inefficient traditional lending market. Aave is at the bleeding edge of this fintech movement, using blockchain technology and engaging with some of the leaders in the new web3 economy, both companies and individuals.

The intended market of Aave's borrowing and lending services is wide, ranging from first time borrowers/ lenders to institutional investors and fund managers. As a decentralised peer to peer platform with a well developed UI, Aave has and is appealing to small crypto traders and investors that have relatively low skill and capital. At them same time massive "hedge funds" like Celsius and 3AC utilise Aave to generate yield on their assets which allows them to offer products to the general public. As such, the potential market for Aave's services includes both small an large lending and borrowing, services usually dominated by banks.

An interesting possible market for the future is commercial loans. A commercial loan is usually backed by some real estate (collateralized). As real estate tokenization becomes more mature, the possibility of Aave engaging in the commercial loan market is likely, opening up, at least, the unsecured part of the commercial lending market which is estimated to reach USD 29, 379.83 Billion in 2030 (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/commercial-lending-market-size-to-reach-usd-29-379-83-billion-in-2030-at-a-cagr-of-13-1--valuates-reports-301469564.html). Some key market players/ competitors who are likely to be disrupted by Aave's growth are American Express, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, and of course the major banks in any given country.
